# Soil-Moisture-Indicator
An Arduino-based IoT project that monitors soil moisture levels using an analog sensor and displays real-time percentage values on the Serial Monitor. Useful for smart farming, gardening, and automated irrigation systems.

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates a **soil moisture monitoring system** built using an **Arduino UNO** and an **analog soil moisture sensor**.  
It measures the volumetric water content in soil, converts it into a **percentage**, and displays it in **real time** on the Serial Monitor.  

Developed as part of the **Internet of Things (20CS32001) PBL project** at Geethanjali College of Engineering and Technology.
